# Vulnerability Management Questionnaire (Comprehensive)

This questionnaire helps small and medium-sized organisations assess their current vulnerability and patch management posture.  
Score each question from **0 to 3**:

- **0 = Not implemented**
- **1 = Partially implemented**
- **2 = Mostly implemented**
- **3 = Fully implemented**

45. Are long‑standing vulnerabilities escalated to management?

---

## 9. Reporting & Metrics

46. Do you produce regular vulnerability reports (weekly/monthly)?
47. Do you measure MTTR (mean time to remediate)?
48. Do you measure patch compliance percentages?
49. Are unresolved critical vulnerabilities escalated?

---

## 10. Continuous Improvement

50. Do you perform annual vulnerability management reviews?
51. Do you conduct penetration tests or external assessments?
52. Do you adjust patch timelines based on threat environment?
